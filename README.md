# DBC
A Card Building Game

# Game Mechanics Overview

## Characters

- **Player Character**: Located at the bottom left corner of the screen with three basic attributes:
  - **Attack**
  - **Defense**
  - **Health**
- Different classes have varying base attributes. After each battle, attributes reset to base values. Buffs or debuffs do not persist after battles.

- **Armor System**: 
  - Both player and enemies possess armor values.
  - Damage depletes armor first, then health.
  - Health below 0 triggers a "ghost state," where if the turn ends, the player/enemy loses. Players can act for one turn in this state to heal or defeat the enemy.

## Rooms

- **Roguelike Map**: Randomly generated with 3 major levels, each containing 5 sub-levels. Room types include:
  1. **Combat Room**: Battles reward coins and a card.
  2. **Intense Combat Room**: Harder battles grant a powerful blessing.
  3. **Shop Room**: Spend coins to buy or remove cards.
  4. **Wanted Room**: Exchange specific cards for coins.
  5. **Campfire Room**: Upgrade cards or restore health.
  6. **Laboratory Room**: Enhance cards in various ways.

## Turns

- Each turn begins with replenishing action points, drawing two cards, and playing cards using action points or energy.
- After the player's turn, the enemy will indicate their next moves, execute them, and then the player's turn resumes.

## Cards

- Cards require action points or energy to play.
- Effects may relate to attack or defense.
- Upgrading a card increases its values by 20%.
- The player's hand limit is 10 cards.
